This is a repository for the waledFPS application built using ElectronJS.

## Overview

waledFPS is an ElectronJS application designed to provide a simple user interface for a Roblox FPS Unlocker. It is really unoptimized, resulting in a large file size, but it works at least as a experiment. Despite its inefficiencies, it offers a one-time installation process and is guaranteed to be virus-free.
